### JS101 Guidelines
So in this practice we want to see that you understand the basic syntax of JavaScript, this practice is for beginners in JS, beginners in Frontend specialization, developers and DevOps who need to know JS syntax:
- Choose good names for variables and functions
- Code should be simple
- The whole test shouldn't take more than 1-3 Hrs
```sh
simple and clean code
```
#### The Task:
- Build a simple guessing game like the one in the demo directory.
- Build the game from scratch, your app should has a unique functions lifecycle, don't use the same methods used in the demo or in the resource below from MDN
- Enhance the input field validation, make it check for non-numerical or null values entered by the user

#### Deliverables

- Edit the files in the directory App/ no need for more files

#### Questions

#### Resources
We recommend going through [A first splash into JavaScript by MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash) before proceeding, this is where the original guess game is discussed.
